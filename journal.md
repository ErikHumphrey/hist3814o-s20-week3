# Journal — Week 3

> Where is the scholarly value in showing one's work? How does this compare  with how you’ve written history to date?

Showing your work makes it easy for yourself and others to reproduce your results. This could be useful if part of your evidence or results are in some way lost, or if someone wants to repeat your study in the exact same way (to verify it), or with slight variations. It also provides some credibility to an author's results, not only showing how to achieve the results, but also potentially proving that the results were not simply taken from someone else's efforts.

Personally, I've not "written history" much in the sense of completing work related to history. None at all in post-secondary studies. I would say that although I tend to show my work in other fields, the history-related work I've done so far has mostly only entailed citing sources (mostly secondary sources) without putting too much thought into verifying their legitimacy. With history work I've done, mainly relating to antiquity, it would unfortunately be nigh impossible to generate new primary sources or to replicate claims, even in a non-scientific sense. In a sense, though, many history textbooks don't include reproduction steps or "showing your work", so that could be why.

> What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do?

My understanding is that regular historians mostly have to cite an egregious amount of sources to make an educated guess that a historical fact is true, as there are many reasons there could be a discrepancy between two historical accounts. History never lies; historians, however...

For digital historians, there's value in showing one's work as to allow the same steps and strategies (e.g. for archival) to be applied to future digital history work. The process can be much more complicated than a scholarly journal and a series of reference, as well, so it's important to show how one came to a certain conclusion, similar to a mathematical proof or a computer science problem.
